# Insight-Sphere-Ecommerce
On-Prem ETL Data Pipeline
E-Commerce retail is experiencing substantial growth over the years. The adoption of online shopping is increasing across the globe, driven by factors such as expanding internet access, multiple payment options like digital payments, and rewarding tech-savvy customer base. The E-Commerce platforms also benefit from the abundant online customer interaction data in the form of reviews. This data offers valuable insights into customer preferences, product quality, selling frequency, and seasonal trends.
Business Flow Proposed:
The project aims to develop a centralized E-Commerce database. The data chosen has an ample amount of transactional as well as descriptive data. This database will help in creating a platform that integrates all the data from customers, sellers, buyers, and producers. Understanding the trends based on various factors will help to increase sales in the market. By processing customer orders, producers and manufacturers gain insights into high-demand products. Reviews of the products given by the buyers will indirectly help the sellers in improving the product in terms of various performance indicators. The holistic view of the platform helps to analyze the patterns and trends associated with the various external factors such as the holiday season, and significant occasions that influence the sale of certain categories of products. Orders also vary from geographical location based on factors like weather and temperature. Thus, to understand and perform data analyses we require a database that connects all the major entities like Customers, Products, Geolocation, Sellers, Order Items, Order Reviews, and Product Categories.

KPI METRICS:
• Total Revenue by State is considered a lagging indicator because it reflects past performance, summarizing how much revenue each state generated over the past two years. This metric relies on completed sales transactions and historical data, capturing outcomes that have already occurred. Due to the time lag in data availability, it's used for retrospective analysis to evaluate historical sales trends and assess the effectiveness of past strategies. Unlike leading indicators that forecast future performance, total revenue by state provides insights into past outcomes and is less predictive of future revenue trends or business direction.

• A line graph indicating sales over years is typically a lagging indicator. It represents historical sales performance by plotting the actual sales figures over past years. This type of graph reflects completed transactions and revenue data that have already occurred, providing a retrospective view of sales trends. The data for such a graph is collected from past records, and there's a time delay in updating and visualizing this information. Businesses use this graph to analyze past sales patterns and identify trends, making it valuable for historical performance evaluation rather than predicting future sales direction. Unlike leading indicators that forecast future trends, a line graph of sales over years looks back at realized sales data.

• The metric "number of deliveries made per quarter" is considered a leading indicator due to its predictive nature and its ability to provide insights into future business performance. An increase in delivery volumes quarter-over-quarter can indicate growing demand and expanding market reach, suggesting potential future sales growth. Monitoring delivery metrics allows businesses to anticipate sales trends and assess operational efficiency, helping to forecast future sales and adapt strategies accordingly. By focusing on the number of deliveries, businesses can proactively respond to changing market dynamics and customer demands, positioning themselves for continued growth and success in upcoming quarters.

• The top 10 product categories based on the quantity of orders can be considered a coincident indicator. This metric reflects current business activity and performance within the reporting period, specifically focusing on the volume of orders for different product categories. Unlike lagging indicators that look back at historical data or leading indicators that forecast future trends, this metric provides real-time insights into which product categories are currently driving sales and customer demand. It directly measures ongoing sales activity and transactional volumes, reflecting the immediate impact of product popularity within the specified period. This information is valuable for assessing current market trends, identifying high-demand products, and optimizing inventory and marketing strategies based on real-time sales data. Therefore, the top 10 product categories based on the quantity of orders serve as a coincident indicator that aligns closely with current business operations and customer purchasing behaviors

• The stacked bar graph showing monthly sales by payment method versus quantity of orders is a real-time indicator of sales and payment trends. It gives immediate insights into which payment methods customers prefer and how they impact order quantities each month. This graph reflects what's happening right now in sales and payment behavior, helping businesses make timely decisions to optimize customer transactions and improve overall performance.
